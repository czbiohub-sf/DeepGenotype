                           [CRISPResso version 2.3.1]                           
[Note that as of version 2.3.0 FLASh and Trimmomatic have been replaced by fastp for read merging and trimming. Accordingly, the --flash_command and --trimmomatic_command parameters have been replaced with --fastp_command. Also, --trimmomatic_options_string has been replaced with --fastp_options_string.

Also in version 2.3.2, when running CRISPRessoPooled in mixed-mode (amplicon file and genome are provided) the default behavior will be as if the --demultiplex_only_at_amplicons parameter is provided. This change means that reads and amplicons do not need to align to the exact locations.]
